# Notes

> "On the Internet, the competition is always just one click away, so if you frustrate users they'll head somewhere else."
## Laws
1. Don't make me think
2. It doesn't matter how mnay times I have to click, as long as each click is a mindless, unambiguous choice
3. Get rid of half the words on each page, then get rid of half of what's left.

### Rules
1. Clarity trumps consistency
  * If you can make something significantly clearer by making it slightly inconsistent, chose in favor of clarity.
2. Format text to support scanning.
  * Headings
  * Short paragraphs
  * Bulleted lists
  * Highlighting keywords
3. Instructions & Happy Talk must die. 
#### Visual hierarchies
1. The more important something is, the more prominent it is.
2. Things that are related logically are related visually.
3. Things are 'nested' visually to show what's part of what.

#### Guidance
* Brief:= smallest amount of info that will help me.
* Timely:= placed so I encounter it exactly when I need it.
* Unavoidable:= Formatted in a wy that ensures that I'll notice.

#### Concise
>"17. Omit needles words
> Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, 
> a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing 
> should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts..."
