# Notes

A really good programmer I knew recommended this book for programming. 
	While reading it I am just trying to compare it to programming. 

> "If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot." 

Doesn't take much work to compare this to programming.


> "Paragraphs are more essential to writing than words or sentences."
- I think 'paragraphs' either breaks down to classes or functions. 
	It's important to put work into a line of code, or variable naming, but 
	other people shouldn't be using that directly. It should be centered
	around the class.

> "Have a toolbox you can dip into and solve problems with"


## Context

This moment is at Stephen King's first job. Below he is quoting his editor at 
	a local Newspaper station. King took his first article to the editor and the 
	the editor gives King some critique which King takes extremely well, he 
	closes with this adage. 

> "'When you write a story, you're telling yourself the story', he said. 
	"'When you rewrite your main job is taking out all the things that 
	are not the story'".
	
- I think this is a great quote for Refactoring. I always see the idea thrown
	around to write the code till it works then refactor it, but this provides 
	and different angle.
	
> "[G]ood story ideas seem to come quite literally from nowhere, sailing at 
	you right out of the empty sky: two previously unrelated ideas come 
	together and make something new under the sun. Your job isn't to find these
	ideas, but to recognize them when they show up."
	
	
> "Starting with the questions and thematic concerns is a recipe for a bad 
	recipe. Good fiction always begins with story and progresses to theme; 
	it almost never beigns with theme and progresses to story. The only 
	possible exceptions to this rule that I can think of are allegories like 
	George Orwell's Animal Farm (and I have a sneakingsuspicition that with 
	Animal Farm the story idea may indeed have come first, if I see Orwell 
	in the afterlife, I mean to ask him). But once your basic story is on 
	paper, you need to think abotu what it means and enrich your following
	drafts with your conclusions. To do less is to rob your work (and 
	eventually your readers) of the vision that meakes each tale you write 
	uniquely your own."
	
## Context
On Writing
> "I did it for the buzz. I did it for the pure joy of the thing. ANd if you
	can do it for joy, you can do it forever."
	

> "Start the story alone without interference."

- I have always liked the idea of surpising people with your work. As 
	opposed to just talking about your idea all the time, you should finish it 
	then reveal it to the world. He keeps going and he holds to the 
	idea to not show people until your first draft is done.
