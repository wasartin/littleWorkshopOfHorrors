# Notes

## Software has two values: 
..* The value of its behavior, and The value of its structure
..* Software is a way to quickly and easily change the behavior of a machine. But that flexibility depends on the shape of the system. 
..* The goal of Architecture is to create a shape for the sys that caters to the policy at the most important part of the system while making the implementation irrelevant. This allows those details to be delayed, and figured out later or by someone else. 

*Goal
> “Is to minimize the human resources required to build & maintain the required system.”

* What is the Theme of Arch?
..* SW Archs are structures built upon use cases of the system.

* What is the Purpose of Architecture?
..* Good Arch is centered around use Cases (Architecture Drivers), so that the arch can safely describe the structures that support those use cases w/o committing to frameworks, tools, and environments. 

* Quotes
>“Architecture represents the significant design decisions that shape a system, where significant is measured by cost of change”
> --<cite> Grady Booch </cite>
